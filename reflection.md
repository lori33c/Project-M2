# Milestone 2

## Description
Describe what you did for this milestone in your own words.

Everyone in our group cooperated in this project. We all have great chemistry together. All of us had a part to do and completed it. If one of us had a problem with one part, we would ask one another for assistance. Pretty much sums up everything for this milestone.

## Challenges encountered
Describe the challenges you encountered while working on this milestone of the project.

The challenges we all faced was the intersects with opponent/opponent projectile, same goes for player. The coding in general was a lot to handle but we all seemed to get it situated when days went by. Managing time was also a challenge we all encountered.

## Things I've learned
What is the most important thing you've learned from this milestone in the project?

The most important thing we learned from this milestone is the Player and Opponent projectile section. We had to focus mainly on that section due to it having many parts. Some of the codes were simple to do and others took awhile to understand and comprehend what its wanting us to do.
